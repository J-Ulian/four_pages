        <h2 class="tab"> This is a page with HIT MASS PROGRAM: 3 DAY HIGH
INTENSITY SPLIT.</h2>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xl-" style="color: white;font-size: large;">
    What follows will be a sample, three day a week, training routine for anyone interested in trying HIT for yourself. If you’ve never tried HIT before or are looking for something new to help you spark some muscle growth, this is for you.
            
    If you’re advanced in HIT or are using a program that’s working for you right now, stick with what you’re doing until you feel like you hit a plateau. Then you can give this program a whirl for yourself.
    
    This program will be a Monday, Wednesday, Friday program with Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends off. When I say off, I mean OFF. Stay away from the gym, don’t think about training, and make sure you stick with a sound nutrition/supplementation plan.
    
    This is a six week program with the goals to be to introduce HIT into your training and create opportunities for hypertrophy.
